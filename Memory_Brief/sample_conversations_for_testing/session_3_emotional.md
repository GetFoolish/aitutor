{"speaker": "AI", "text": "Hey Alex. Welcome back for session three. We're shifting gears a bit today to look at word problems using quadratics. Ready to dive in?"}
{"speaker": "Student", "text": "hey. yeah. whatever."}
{"speaker": "AI", "text": "Everything okay? You seem a little down."}
{"speaker": "Student", "text": "just a bad day. parents on my back about grades. feeling kinda overwhelmed."}
{"speaker": "AI", "text": "I'm sorry to hear that. Pressure from home makes everything harder. Do you want to talk about it, or would you prefer to distract yourself with some work?"}
{"speaker": "Student", "text": "let's just work. i need to get this over with."}
{"speaker": "AI", "text": "Okay. We'll keep it focused. Word problems often scare people because they bury the math in a story. Let's look at this one: 'A rocket is launched from the ground. Its height h in meters after t seconds is given by $h = -4.9t^2 + 19.6t$. When does it hit the ground?'"}
{"speaker": "Student", "text": "ugh. physics. i don't know. i see decimals and i just check out."}
{"speaker": "AI", "text": "Ignore the decimals for a second. Just look at the question: 'When does it hit the ground?' If something is on the ground, what is its height?"}
{"speaker": "Student", "text": "zero?"}
{"speaker": "AI", "text": "Exactly. So the problem is really just asking: Solve for $t$ when $h = 0$."}
{"speaker": "Student", "text": "okay. so $0 = -4.9t^2 + 19.6t$?"}
{"speaker": "AI", "text": "Yes. Now, look at the equation. Do you see a common factor we can pull out?"}
{"speaker": "Student", "text": "t? they both have t."}
{"speaker": "AI", "text": "Right. Factor out the $t$."}
{"speaker": "Student", "text": "$t(-4.9t + 19.6) = 0$."}
{"speaker": "AI", "text": "Perfect. Now, if two things multiplied together equal zero, one of them MUST be zero. So either $t = 0$ OR..."}
{"speaker": "Student", "text": "$-4.9t + 19.6 = 0$."}
{"speaker": "AI", "text": "Exactly. $t=0$ makes sense because that's launch time. Now solve the second part for the landing time."}
{"speaker": "Student", "text": "move 19.6 over... $-4.9t = -19.6$. then divide. i don't have a calculator. this is stupid."}
{"speaker": "AI", "text": "Take a breath. 19.6 is actually $4.9 \times 4$. Does that help?"}
{"speaker": "Student", "text": "i don't know! i can't do that in my head right now. can we just skip this?"}
{"speaker": "AI", "text": "Whoa, okay. I'm pushing too hard. I'm sorry. Let's pause."}
{"speaker": "Student", "text": "it's just too much right now. i can't think."}
{"speaker": "AI", "text": "That's valid. Your brain is full of stress, it's hard to fit math in there too. Let's step away from the rocket. Think about basketball practice."}
{"speaker": "Student", "text": "..."}
{"speaker": "AI", "text": "When your coach draws up a play, he doesn't just write equations, right? He draws lines showing where people move."}
{"speaker": "Student", "text": "yeah. x's and o's."}
{"speaker": "AI", "text": "This problem is just an alley-oop. $t=0$ is the pass leaving your hands. The vertex is the ball at the highest point. The second answer is the dunk."}
{"speaker": "Student", "text": "okay."}
{"speaker": "AI", "text": "We found $t=0$ (the pass). We just need to find when the dunk happens. The math is just the rules of the game."}
{"speaker": "Student", "text": "i guess i get that. sorry for snapping. it's just loud at my house right now. max is barking, mom is yelling."}
{"speaker": "AI", "text": "Hey, no apology needed. We all have a limit. Is Max sensing the stress in the house?"}
{"speaker": "Student", "text": "yeah he always knows. he's hiding under my desk right now licking my foot."}
{"speaker": "AI", "text": "That's his way of trying to help. Emotional support dog in training? So, if $t=4$, that's 4 seconds of hang time. That's a pretty high lob."}
{"speaker": "Student", "text": "yeah 4 seconds is a long time for a ball to be in the air."}
{"speaker": "AI", "text": "So the answer is just 4 seconds. That's it. No more decimals."}
{"speaker": "Student", "text": "okay. that's actually not that bad when you say it like that."}
{"speaker": "AI", "text": "We'll stick to the sports context. It clearly works for you. Let's try one more, but simple. A player shoots. The ball follows $h = -x^2 + 4x + 2$. Find the max height."}
{"speaker": "Student", "text": "max height is the top of the curve. the vertex?"}
{"speaker": "AI", "text": "Yes! And the x-coordinate of the vertex is always at $-b / 2a$. It's the center of the court."}
{"speaker": "Student", "text": "so... b is 4, a is -1. so -4 divided by -2?"}
{"speaker": "AI", "text": "Exactly."}
{"speaker": "Student", "text": "that's 2. so at 2 seconds it's at the top?"}
{"speaker": "AI", "text": "You got it. Now plug that 2 back into the equation to find the actual height."}
{"speaker": "Student", "text": "$-(2)^2 + 4(2) + 2$. so... -4 + 8 + 2."}
{"speaker": "AI", "text": "Keep going."}
{"speaker": "Student", "text": "4 + 2 is 6. so 6 feet? meters?"}
{"speaker": "AI", "text": "Let's say meters. 6 meters is high! But the math is perfect."}
{"speaker": "Student", "text": "okay. i feel a little better. catching that pattern helps."}
{"speaker": "AI", "text": "You did great to recover from the frustration. That's a skill in itself. Give Max a pat for me?"}
{"speaker": "Student", "text": "will do. thanks for being patient today."}
{"speaker": "AI", "text": "Anytime, Alex. Hang in there."}
