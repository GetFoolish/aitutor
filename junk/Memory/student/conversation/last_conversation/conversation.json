    "speaker": "Student",
    "text": "Yeah, the thing is um I I am a programmer and I am actually trying to figure out what the details of the universe are."

    "speaker": "AI",
    "text": "That's quite a fascinating goal. As a programmer, what aspects of the universe are you trying to understand?"

    "speaker": "AI",
    "text": "That sounds like a very interesting project. Are you using any particular programming language or physics library for your simulation?"

    "speaker": "Student",
    "text": "Yeah tell me libraries"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "AI",
    "text": "Some popular choices include Box2D, PhysX, and Bullet. Have you considered any of these, or do you have specific requirements for your physics engine?"
